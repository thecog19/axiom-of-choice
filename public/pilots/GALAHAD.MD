Squire Gilbert of House Hawkwood hails from the planet Volpone, a feudal world reigned by families of competing techno-nobles. Each of the major houses controls vast swathes of the planet, with personal fiefdoms the size of whole nations during Cradleâ€™s pre-space era. Each major house in turn commands the loyalty of numerous smaller houses. The chain of vows and loyalty further extend down to the peasantry who, in return for the gallant protection offered by the great and minor houses, do all of the actual work on Volpone. 

Gilbert is a third child of a minor backwater house, pledged to a middling major house. As such, he stands to inherit no lands or titles from his mother, the Matriarch of House Hawkwood. He has instead turned to the most popular profession available to spare heirs on Volpone: striking out as a free blade. If he can earn renown or acclaim on his own, then perhaps he may be invited to join the knightly orders of a major Volpone house or even found his own dynasty on Volpone or somewhere else in the galaxy. 

Gilbert has grown up consuming tales of chivalry and knightly valor. While experienced in the ways of war and courtly decorum he has never left Volpone until now. He is woefully naive and optimistic, earnestly clasping to his ideals of bravery, fidelity and honor.
