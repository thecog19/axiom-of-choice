I'm going for a grizzled old war veteran personality. Probably a former Harrison Armory legionnaire. She's served in countless conflicts on foot, but hasn't ever piloted a mech before. 

Despite having since retired from the HA military, she insists on being referred to by her rank title. "I earned that in the field of battle!" 

She's 142 subjective years old, constantly gonna be talking about how things were "back in the Armory" using excessive hyperbole. (uphill both ways type stuff)
