### SUNDAY BBQ [ROUTINE PATROL MISSION II]

The forces of OCCULT pinned down the Black Carders with saturated artillery fire, and our brave Knights [down one member, who's mech suffered sudden mechanical failure] squared off against the fearsome **CITADEL CRUSHER**. After a showdown that resulted in most of the terrain on the map being eradicated, multiple lost points of structure, and a heroic pilot shooting a ronin in the back in order to secure the final point, the Knights are victorious, if battered. 

**MAIN OBJECTIVE: SUCCESS** [barely] 
Reward: The Black Carder survivors are able to evacuate, though significantly more battered than the Knights, they won't be good for *fighting* anything anytime soon. 

Reward: Between achieving this main objective and the previous main objective, you have earned a **Full Repair**
