At the core of the ruins of the research base, the Knights, with the help of stalwart Black Carder Minos, held against the enemy forces. Despite an endless rain of missiles, a sniper with a grudge against melee mechs, a fleet of drones, a ENDBRINGER class bomb being deployed against them and Mordred himself trying to pry pilots out of their mechs before exploding in a cataclysmic explosion... the Knights held fast, as the bodies of the enemy piled around them. 

I a showdown that will become a thing of legends, The Knights proved their mettle and saved their charges from utter ruination.
