### MORNING RADIO [ROUTINE PATROL MISSION III]

Moving onto the abandoned research base, the Knights found nothing but ruins... and a new nemesis, as well as an old enemy. **Mordred and Oberon** put on a valiant fight, but were disarmed by the Knight's gallantry. And a combination of heavy arms fire, swords and hacking. The Knights were barely able to repulse the enemy force, just in time to activate the distress comms beacon and summon help. Terminus is sending three gunships, which they've had ready and waiting since the entire satellite network went dark. 

**MAIN OBJECTIVE: SUCCESS**

Reward: The enemy has been repulsed for now. The scientists hastily assemble and deploy the distress beacon, which fires a low-altitude coms drone, allowing a message to punch through the interference and radio Terminus. Loss of life was averted. You also know the enemy much better than anyone else on the planet now. That alone could tip the scales in as Terminus struggles for survival

Help is on the way. 

The enemy is massing. 

One last desperate fight. 

See you next time for **LAST STAND PICNIC**
