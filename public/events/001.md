### WALK IN THE PARK [ROUTINE PATROL MISSION I]

Our brave mercernary crew squared off against the forces of OCCULT, an unknown hostile group of mechs that don't seem to have pilots. They managed to route the opposing force and secure the exit path for the science crew.

**MAIN OBJECTIVE:** SUCCESS

Reward: Most of the science crew wasn't slaughtered by hostiles and you were able to evacuate almost all of the science trucks, which will make your retreat easier and give you a broader access to repairs than you would have otherwise had. 

**SECONDARY OBJECTIVE**: SUCCESS 

The scanner drone can be repurposed as an advanced scouting drone. Gain reserves: 


**COPERNICUS SCOUT DRONE RESERVE**
